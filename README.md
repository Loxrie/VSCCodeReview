# VSCCodeReview
A simple Visual Studio Code plugin.

Use the context menu to open a file for code review, this loads any saved state.
Or use the context menu to mark a selection as read, this will color the scroll bar to indicate you've read those lines of code. Marked lines are saved to state.
Reset file removes all marks, so you can start again.

I use apple-alt-shift-R to open, apple-shift-R to read and leave reset unbound to a shortcut.  This hovers close to some default keybindings in VSC but I find it OK.
